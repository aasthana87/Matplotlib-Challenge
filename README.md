Observations and InsightsÂ¶

Capomulin and Ramicane have the most timepoints available with the smallest mean and median tumor size.

Based on the final tumor volume visualized in the box plots, Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be more effective in reducing tumor size when compared to infubinol and ceftamin.

For the Capomulin treatment, there is a reliable positive correlation between mice weight and average tumor size (r=0.83). In other words, as a mouse's weight increases, the average tumor volume also increases. The heavier the mouse, the less effective Capomulin may be in reducing tumor volume.
